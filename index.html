                Hello! Here's a quick background on me. I previously worked in
                marketing as a graphic designer and copywriter but went through
                two layoffs in two years during the Great Recession and decided
                to completely change careers. I did a Ruby on Rails bootcamp
                seven years ago which was not very good. I honestly never really
                figured out how to program Ruby during that time, but it did
                open doors and got me into a tech career as a web support
                technician for a newspaper company.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                I did that for a year before being recruited by an adtech
                company where I’ve worked for the past five years as a sales
                engineer. My position has evolved quite a bit in those five
                years and I now see a big need for me to really learn
                programming so I can build tools for my team and query our
                database more effectively and efficiently. Not to mention I feel
                like I’ve plateaued in my position and want to do bigger things
                and advance in my career. So, I decided to take a step back and
                do a fullstack bootcamp to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and
                build a really strong foundation in programming.
              </p>
