                Hello! Here's a quick background on me. I previously worked in
                marketing as a graphic designer and copywriter but went through
                two layoffs in two years during the Great Recession and decided
                to completely change careers. I did a Ruby on Rails bootcamp
                seven years ago which was not very good. I honestly never really
                figured out how to program Ruby during that time, but it did
                open doors and got me into a tech career as a web support
                technician for a newspaper company. I did that for a year before
                being recruited by an adtech company where I’ve worked for the
                past five years as a sales engineer. My position has evolved
                quite a bit in those five years and I now see a big need for me
                to really learn programming so I can build tools for my team and
                query our database more effectively and efficiently. Not to
                mention I feel like I’ve plateaued in my position and want to do
                bigger things and advance in my career. So, I decided to take a
                step back and do a fullstack bootcamp to fill in the gaps in my
                knowledge and build a really strong foundation in programming.
