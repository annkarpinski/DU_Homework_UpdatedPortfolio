                Ann Karpinski grew up in Little Falls, MN and attended the
                University of Minnesota – Twin Cities earning a B.S. degree in
                Journalism and Fisheries & Wildlife Management. She spent the
                next 10 years working in communications for several
                environmental non-profits in Minnesota, Washington DC, and
                Colorado. During this time she studied graphic design and
                photography to compliment her copywriting skills. After a year
                of working as a greeting card verse writer (because, why not?!)
                she decided to completely shake things up and attend a Ruby on
                Rails bootcamp to help her get her foot in the door in the tech
                industry.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Her first job in tech was as a web support specialist for a
                newspaper company in Denver. After a year there, she was
                recruited by adtech company SpotX in 2015 as a technical
                operations engineer. A little over a later she was promoted to
                solutions engineer and works in that role today as a conduit
                between business operations and engineering. She loves finding
                tech solutions that will help her clients succeed in
                programmatic advertising. In a curious twist of fate, she now
                finds herself working with the broadcasters, publishers, and
                media companies that she admired growing up and prompted her to
                pursue a journalism degree. Transitioning to a tech career has
                opened up exciting doors for her..

              <p class="card-text">
                With the exception of the Ruby on Rails bootcamp, Ann has not
                received a formal education in tech. So in March 2020, she
                decided to tackle the University of Denver’s full-stack software
                development bootcamp to fill in gaps in her knowledge and to
                immerse herself in the life of a software developer. She expects
                to graduate in September 2020.
